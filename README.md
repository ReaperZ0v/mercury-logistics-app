# Mercury Logistics Tracking App
A full stack web application developed using the Django REST Framework and React, allows the user to enter a tracking number and fetch details relating to that tracking number (parcel/consignment data) from the database.

# Points
> * REST API uses ```APIView``` class within the logic for a more customized flow 
> * Front End has 2 components which are ```<ErrorAlert />``` and ```<SearchBar />``` linking back to ```App.js```
> * Conditional rendering was used quite a lot on the front end :)
